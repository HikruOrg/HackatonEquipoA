# 4. Never commit the .env file to version control
# 5. For demo purposes, the app will work without these credentials (with limited functionality)

# AUTHENTICATION FLOW:
# - If MICROSOFT_GRAPH_CLIENT_SECRET is empty: Uses InteractiveBrowserCredential (delegated auth - requires browser login)
# - If MICROSOFT_GRAPH_CLIENT_SECRET is set: Uses ClientSecretCredential (app-only auth - no user interaction needed)
# 
# For production services, use Option 2 (app-only auth) and grant "Mail.Read" permission to the app in Azure AD admin center.
